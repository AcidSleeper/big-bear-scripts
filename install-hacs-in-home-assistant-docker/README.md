# About

The install-hacs-in-home-assistant-docker script automates the installation of the Home Assistant Community Store (HACS) into a Home Assistant instance running inside a Docker container. HACS extends Home Assistant by providing easy access to a large repository of additional integrations, plugins, themes, and custom components that are not available in the official Home Assistant store. These contributions come from the Home Assistant community and can greatly enhance and personalize your Home Assistant experience.
